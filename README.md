# Docker Basics

This repository provides a basic overview of Docker, including its key concepts, components, and essential commands.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package an application with all its dependencies and environment in a single package.

## Key Concepts and Components

### Containers

- **Containers** are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that can run virtually anywhere.
- They encapsulate an application along with its dependencies and environment in a single image.

### Images

- **Docker images** are read-only templates that define how a container should be constructed.
- An image includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
- Images are built using a **Dockerfile**.

### Dockerfile

- A **Dockerfile** is a script that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.
- Common instructions include specifying a base image (`FROM`), copying files (`COPY`), setting environment variables (`ENV`), and defining the command to run the application (`CMD`).

### Docker Hub

- **Docker Hub** is a cloud-based repository where Docker users can store and share images.
- It provides a large library of pre-built images, which can be used as a base for creating new images.

### Docker Engine

- The **Docker Engine** is the core software that enables containers to run on a system.
- It consists of three main components:
  - **Docker Daemon** (`dockerd`): The background service responsible for managing containers.
  - **REST API**: The interface through which Docker interacts with the Docker Daemon.
  - **Docker CLI**: The command-line interface used to interact with the Docker Daemon and manage containers.

### Volumes

- **Volumes** are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
- They provide a way to store data outside of the container's filesystem, making it easy to share data between containers or backup data.

### Networking

- Docker provides various networking options to manage how containers communicate with each other and the outside world.
- Common types include:
  - **Bridge Network**: The default network, which allows containers to communicate within the same host.
  - **Host Network**: Containers share the host’s network stack.
  - **Overlay Network**: Allows containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate securely.

### Docker Compose

- **Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- It uses a YAML file to configure the application’s services, networks, and volumes.

## Basic Docker Commands

Here are some essential Docker commands to get you started:

- **Build an image**: `docker build -t myimage .`
- **List images**: `docker images`
- **Run a container**: `docker run -d -p 80:80 myimage`
- **List running containers**: `docker ps`
- **List all containers**: `docker ps --all`
- **Stop a container**: `docker stop container_id`
- **Remove a container**: `docker rm container_id`
- **Remove an image**: `docker rmi image_id`

## Advantages of Using Docker

- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker without modification.
- **Scalability**: Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, reducing conflicts and dependencies.
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient and lightweight compared to traditional VMs.

By using Docker, developers can ensure their applications run consistently across different environments, simplifying both development and deployment processes.
